# Time-series-forecasting-for-Tesla
This Jupyter notebook goes through the use of ARIMA model to predict stock prices using historical data. This is just a practice notebook for me to work on time series analysis and does not serve as advice in investing in stocks
The original dataset used can be found here: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/history?period1=1436486400&period2=1594339200&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d
